# SuDiet
The goal of this project is to develop an Android
application which provides an effectively trackable blood
pressure and glucose levels also by improving diet and medicine suggestions, ultimately,
preventing or delaying further complications of diabetes. Using
SuDiet, an agile software development approach, the team
gathered requirements, designed, and implemented a
smartphone application utilizing the Android platforms. This
application will help the users to identify certain information
and knowledge regarding diabetes and help them record day to day changes in glucose levels by interacting with the
android app. Based on the userâ€™s data received, the user will be
getting some suggestion of medicines that are available at the
local chemist without prescription with an advice to visit the
doctor. This application is more effective, quick in providing medical information.
